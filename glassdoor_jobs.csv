Mercury
In the 1840s, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace worked on an early version of the computer known as the “Analytics Engine”. In the words of computing historian Doron Swade, “What Lovelace saw...was that numbers could represent entities other than quantity” and together they laid the foundation for general-purpose computing.
While much has changed since then, the importance of numbers in building great technology remains. We’re looking for Data Scientists who can help us build our analytics engine by making meaning from data and identifying opportunities for improvement.
In this role, you’ll be responsible for proactively deriving data insights and partnering with engineering, marketing, design, onboarding, and other product business teams to inform how we invest in and build Mercury’s future.
